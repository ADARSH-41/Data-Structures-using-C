# Data-Structures-using-C
This repository guides you through all the data structures and Algorithms implemented using C language. 
The key points will be guided using comments parallel to key lines or block of code(s).
The scope of this repository is to implement datastructures like LinkedLists,Stacks,Queues,Trees and Graphs 
and simple Searching and sorting algorithms like linear search, merge sort using C language.
